# RAG Evaluation

`insintct.cpp` have many components that play different role in a RAG pipeline. Evaluation becomes a complex yet critical task to ensure overall performance.

In the following sections, we will discuss:

* Evaluation process for general RAG pipelines.
* Comparison experiments with `langchain` as baseline.
* Trivial ablation study on embedding dimensions, context length, foundation model.

## Evaluation process

## Experiments

As these are code-intensive experiments, they are written in Jupyter Notebook:
